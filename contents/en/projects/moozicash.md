## Context 

<a href="wwww.moozistudio.com" target="_blank">MooziStudio</a> is a digital agency creating solutions for the digital transformation of companies. It is composed of a mainly young team and develops solutions in an international context.

Thanks to its know-how in customer relations, Moozistudio initiated the development of a digital loyalty platform called Moozicash.

Moozicash's mission is to bring brands and their customers together by designing and deploying loyalty programs to recruit, develop and retain customers.

The application allows customers to accumulate points with partner brands for each purchase made and spend them in the network of partner stores.

## The Mission 

As part of this project, I was contacted by Moozistudio to work on the user experience, the visual identity, and the redesign of the interfaces of their mobile application and the design of a **landing page** to launch the product.

Although several versions of the application have already been developed by the time I joined the project, the management team was still not satisfied with the rendering of the application.

## Why the needed to redesign ?

Before proceeding with the redesign of the mobile application, I started an audit of the existing to immerse myself in the project, its implications, the need for redesign and identifying areas for improvement.

#### Audit 

I started the audit by identifying the user flows and implemented a score-based evaluation based on Nielsen's heuristics in order to detect the accessibility of the interfaces and the potential points of friction within the application.

The table below summarizes the problems identified as well as the solutions envisaged to solve them.

<table class="table">
<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Users flows / Screen</th>
		<th>Identified Issues</th>
		<th>Solutions</th>
	</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>authentication Process</td>
		<td>inconsistent fields between account creation and authentication</td>
		<td>Provide different modes of authentication</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>account creation screen</td>
		<td>Large number of fields to enter inducing the user in error<br> Not taken into account of the forgotten password case </td>
		<td>Allow account creation via a single input field</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Account consultation and promotions</td>
		<td>Readability of the interface</td>
		<td>Redesigner les interfaces selon les guidelines  android</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

At the end of this audit, the following areas for improvement were highlighted:
* Review the information architecture within the application
* Suggest new interfaces to solve the problems identified

### You say you need a redesign ? 

The audit done, I had a better understanding of the new expectations of the team and future features that will integrate the new version of the application.
One of the goals for the company was to increase the number of registrations and downloads of the mobile application.

## Ideation et Conception

The directions obtained in collaboration with the development team and the marketing team allowed me to draw sketches on paper then wireframes on software.

Once a direction obtained, I started the design of the interfaces then the realization of **prototype low fidelity** with the software **<a href="www.justinmind.com" target="_blank">JustInMind</a>**

## Tests and Feedbacks

To test the relevance of the new interfaces, we have gathered some customers within the studio. After presenting them the prototype and without giving them too many indications (shadowing technique: wink :), we asked them to perform the following tasks:
* Create an account
* Consult the promotions of partner brands
* Spend their points by scanning their qr Code
* Consult their balance

We wanted to determine:
* If The account creation process had been simplified?
* If errors occurring when creating an account are avoided?
* If the app is attractive and easy to use

These workshops were very instructive and highlighted the need for this overhaul. Errors caused by account creation were reduced by 78%.

## Designing the landing page

Always with the aim of increasing the number of registrations and acquiring new prospects, I was also responsible for designing the landing that will promote the mobile app. 

#### How to acquire leads?

One solution I proposed was for a user to be able to directly register and create his account by simply submitting his phone number.
The latter would receive an SMS allowing him to download the mobile application and validate his account by completing his profile.
