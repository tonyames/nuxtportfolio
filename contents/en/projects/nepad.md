## Context

NEPAD-IPPF) is a multi-donor Special Fund hosted by the African Development Bank (AfDB). NEPAD-IPPF supports African countries to prepare regional infrastructure projects in Energy, ICT, Transport and Transboundary Water aligned to Continental Infrastructure Initiatives ".

For launching their activity the NEPAD-IPPF's  team wanted a modern website that would showcase the projects they support, their realizations and provide insights and data to their investors and stakeholders

## Let's Ideate

 Once i had the brief, i tried to get inspiration from the websites provided by NEPAD-IPPF's team and have done some research base on existing projects, similar organizations and the team feedbacks. Bellow is a summary of key words and a moodboard used as direction.
<div class="row mt-4 mb-4">
<div class= "col-12 col-md-4 align-items-center">

#### The Key words

* Institution 
* Partnership 
* Infrastructures
* Regional
* African
* Funding
</div>
<div class= "col-12 col-md-8 align-items-center">

#### Moodboard

## Prototyping

With those Key words in mind, i started some sketches on paper to figure out the information architecture  since the future website will embbed
promoted events, projects articles, data visualizations and many more.

The project's first milestone was to provide the pages to present the institution, the current projects and application process for funding.
After many sketches on paper, i tried to replicate ideas in the prototyping tool **Adobe XD**.

## From  wireframe to final product #5

Submitting the wireframes for review to the team allowed us to get aligned and define clearly the changes to be made and the expectations on the final product. One of the challenges was through content hierarchy and design solutions  **to make a content heavy website look pleasant and readdable**
