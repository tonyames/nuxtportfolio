## Context 

MTN Benin  the phone operator MTN's branch based in Benin is evolving in a highly competitive sector.The company must remain relevant to high quality standards, continuously increase customers satisfaction while maintaining team efficiency and reducing the cost.

As an innovative Company, MTN Benin partnered with **E-Business Afrique** a Digital Agency to design a tool that will allow their teams to train their staff and keep them delivering more value to their customers. 

After multiple workshops, feedback, and meetings the Online Training platform was born but was only available as a web platform. 

A mobile experience of the training platform was needed and as **E-Business Afrique**  **ux designer** i took the challenge. 

## Understanding the users goals 

One of the challenge i had on this project was to get access to the end users. Although the web platform was already in use, the users feedbacks was provided by the team's the project manager and through requirements. 
The problems was well stated and user goals when using the app was clearly defined.

#### User Stories
 Below are some relevant users stories that guide me in my process :

1. *As an agent of a department, i can browse courses by categories so i can get train on specific process*
2. *As an agent, i can pass test, so i can prove my knowledge to my managers*
3. *As an agent of a department, i can submit a subject in the forum so i can get help on it*
4. *As an agent, i can join a live conference so i can attend and share ideas in real time to my colleagues*



## Prototyping the app from User Flows to Wireflows

Studying the requirements allowed me to highlight informations architecture  and user flows within the mobile app.

#### Sketches

The user goals in mind, i tried some sketches and once the flows was cleary defined i moved to design the wireframes in the **JustInmind Prototyping Tool**.

## Prototyping the app in High Fidelity

I submitted the wireframes to the team to gather feeback on feasibility, and co-create the iterations of the product.

##### Applying Brand identity and Material design guidelines

In order for the app to get acceptance from the users and stay consistent according to the company brand, i have done some colors research on  used on the company's existing products.

Using an online tool allowing extraction of the color palette of a website and google's **<a href="https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0" target="_blank">material design color tool</a>** to ease up the choice of colors relevant to material design system, i designed the **High fidelity** version of the prototype

    </div>

    <div class=col-4>
        <img class="img-fluid" src=/projects/e-training-platform/hifi-prototype.gif>
    </div>
</div>


### Final Product 

The **high fidelity** prototype was shared with the Stakeholders withe the team we achieve the development of the app according to the design **at 97%**.
In fact some new cases occured like the increasing number of courses categories or the availability to pass test within the app. 
Thoses changes were handle smoothly.
