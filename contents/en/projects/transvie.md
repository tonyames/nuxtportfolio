## The Context 

Transvie is a Senegalese health insurance company helping individuals and companies in getting health services. created in 2008, the company kept growing and in 2019 they felt the need to rebrand and redesign their website to get a modern look, reinforce trust through their new brand identity.


## Why they needed a redesign ?

Before the redesign of their website, i team up with marketing expert to make an audit of the existing website and identify issues and improvements possibilities by running different tests on performance, images, content hierarchy and consistency.

#### Usability matters

For example, i tested the homepage according to **<a href="https://www.userfocus.co.uk/resources/homepagechecklist.html" target="_blank">home page usability guidelines</a>**

For instance, the navigation bar links in the header presented some legibility issue due to **bad contrast**  (1.43 in chrome dev tool).

Also the headings on several images was not readable.

#### Content is King, if when well presented !

From an user experience perspective, we noticed for example that the home page lacked content hierarchy leading to an unprofessional feeling.

## The new goals

With the audit and client feedback, the website have to allow visitors to browse the different insurance offers and pay online with their credit card. 
With that in mind, we set the requirements and  the new website have to convey a sense of a **modern company**, **security  and trust** and **be aligned with the new branding materials** of the company.


##### Give a modern and trendy look
To **give a modern and trendy look**, i decided to use illustrations since it's part of 2019 trends in web design and used by many modern digital product website.

##### Build trust among diaspora
 the service targeted the Senegalese diaspora as primary personna which are used to high standards and quality website.
I worked on the copy with the marketing expert to provide the wordings to **build trust** and guide the visitor toward discovering the offers and subscribe for one.

##### Provide accessibility 
I choose colors that are aligned with the brand and health industry but also that **provide web accessibility** so that all visitors browse the site easyly.

## Prototyping
 
 I iterated from the old version and tried to rethink content hierarchy and information architechture using **Adobe XD**
