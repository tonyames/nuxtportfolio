## The Context 

Transvie is a Senegalese health insurance company helping individuals and companies in getting health services. created in 2008, the company kept growing and in 2019 they felt the need to rebrand and redesign their website to get a modern look, reinforce trust through their new brand identity.


## Why they needed a redesign ?

Before the redesign of their website, i team up with marketing expert to make an audit of the existing website and identify issues and improvements possibilities by running different tests on performance, images, content hierarchy and so on.

### Usability matters

For example, i tested the homepage according to **<a href="https://www.userfocus.co.uk/resources/homepagechecklist.html" target="_blank">home page usability guidelines</a>** 

For instance, the navigation bar links in the header presented some legibility issue due to **bad contrast**  (1.43 in chrome dev tool)

Also the headings on several images was not readable

### Content is King, when well presented !

From an user experience perspective, we noticed that the home page lacked content hierarchy giving an overwhelming sensation.
