## Context 

Countrypocket is a startup who aims to connect customers to home service providers so they can get their daily tasks and services done smoothly and efficiently.
The services were ordered through an android app or by the web platform
As the in-house ux/ui designer i was in charge of providing the designs for the android application and design and implement the web interfaces.

## Challenges on designing the app

Before designing the app, i ran several brainstorming sessions with developers, marketers, salesman and IT experts to have an **holistic** approach on what we were trying to achieve and identify earlier the technical limitations.

One of the biggest challenges was on the information architecture since **every service provided by the app could itself be an entire app resulting in different users flows** according to the task the users wanted to perform or the services they wanted to order.

## Ideation & Concepts

Collaborating with different people and using Design thinking methodologies, allowed me to iterate on different approach and concepts till we get to the best solution for the business goals and user experience.

## Prototyping the MVP
### The Android App 

As a startup, we had to move fast and fail fast so that we could learn from feedbacks and iterate again to have the best user experience. for prototyping, i used **JustInmind Prototyper** since it can handle complex interactions and **Adode XD**  to design the web interfaces to speed up my workflow thanks to several handy plugins.

With the prototype communication with development team and stakeholders were easy. it provided understanding and alignment among all the people involved in building the product.



### Designing for the Web 

For the web app, the goal was to gather some leads and get users to download the mobile app. 
For that purpose, on key services where presented on the web.

After several versions and feedbacks, the landing page was ready and we started to collect leads and feedback to improve the product.
